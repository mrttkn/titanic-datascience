Titanic Survivor Prediction Project
This project aims to predict Titanic survivors using various machine learning algorithms. The steps involved in this project are:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loaded the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and performed initial data exploration.
Data Cleaning and Processing: Filled missing values, transformed categorical variables into numerical format, and scaled the data.
Descriptive Analytics: Analyzed the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.
Predictive Analytics: Implemented three machine learning algorithms - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN Classifier - to predict the survival of passengers.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.
Reporting: Documented the problem, methodology, and results in a comprehensive report.
